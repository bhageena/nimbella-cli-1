## About Nimbella.

We're building a beautiful cloud so your experience is delightful, one
that allows you to focus on what you do best: explore idea, create
value, and deliver applications that you are proud of. We are excited
to see what you will build today, and we want to hear from you: what
worked, what didn't, what we can do better â€” after all, we are not
done and there is more to come. Reach us on
[Slack](https://nimbella-community.slack.com/) or on
[GitHub](https://github.com/nimbella/nimbella-cli/issues). Your
Nimbella cloud account gives you all of the following features and
benefits:

- A dedicated and secure domain name for your cloud applications. If
  you need more, let us know.
- Static front-end assets are automatically deployed to and served
  from a global CDN.
- Back-ends are run on demand, near-instantly. No servers for you to
  be bothered with, ever.
- Upload files to a secured data bucket, grant limited access as
  needed.
- Record application state in a key-value store, with data accessible
  to all your back-end logic at extremely low latency.
- Build workflows and orchestrate long running tasks.

This repository contains the source to our `nim` command line tool.
Our plan is to open it for contributions but those policies are not in place yet.
Currently, to build it

```
npm install
npm pack
```

This gives you a tarball that can be installed globally or locally.
